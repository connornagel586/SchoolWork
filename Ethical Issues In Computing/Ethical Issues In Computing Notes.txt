Intellectual Property

Hot outside
Stuck inside
A Summer Spent Cold

This haiku is my intellectual property.
You could keep it a secret
You could write it on a wall and forfiet ownership of the haiku
You could enter it in a contest, assigning ownership to the company running the contest
You could license it for $$ to someone
	you still own it
	The license text specifies what rights the licensee purchased

Western law protects your intellectual property
Much of that law was written prior to software

Trade Secret
	A secret formula, design, software algorithm, or data
	Not knowns by others
	Is not obvious to others
	Confidential
	Provides an economic benefit to its owner
	Owner exerts reasonable efforts to maintain the secret

Software Trade Secrets

	Candidates include web applications and services
		Customers dont have access to the source or binary code
		Difficult to reverse-engineer without any code
	May be most widely used protection of server-side code
	Occasionally attempted by client-side applications
		Reverse engineering is technically difficult but not infeasible
	May grow in popularity with cloud-based services

Non-Compete Clause: The receiver of the information agrees not to go into business and compete with the providing party

Reverse-Engineering
Employee Poaching


Copyright

	Copyright identifies
		Who owns the work
		When it was created
		Rights

	
	Legal Rights
		Create Copies
		Distribute or sell the copies
		Create adaptations, known as derivative works
		Display, exhibit, perform, use the work publicly
		Sell some or all of the rights to another party
		Control the reproduction, distribution, display, performance by others

Fair Use
	Purpose and character of the use
		Educational vs. commercial
		Private vs. public
	Nature of the copyrighted work
		Nonfiction vs. fiction
		Published vs. unpublished
	Fraction of the total work being reproduced/distributed
	Impact upon the potential market for the copyrighted work
		Out-of-print vs. currently available


Software copyrights
	Copyright act of 1976 recognizes software copyrights
		Copyrights protects an implementation of an idea
		Not the idea itself
		
		Microsoft own the copyright for the Windows implementation of an operation system
		But Microsoft does not own a copyright on operating systems.

	Software media cost is minimal
	Software reproduction is easy, even compared to photocopier
	And distribution is vastly less expensive than print
	But software development effort is very high

		Spontaneously chosen vs. assigned reading

Nearly All Commercial Software is Copyrighted
	Most Open Source Software (Linux, Eclipse, Apache, etc)
