Project 1


Author: Connor Nagel
Class: CS253 Section 1

Overview
	
	This program takes in text and counts the number of characters, words, digits and lines used in the input text.


Compiling and Using

	To compile the code use: gcc -Wall main.c
	
	Once the code has been compiled, use ./a.out < data to run the program. The output will then be displayed on the screen.


Testing

	I used the provided data file to compare the results from my code to the results from the given program 'grader'. This way I was able to know what parts of the code still needed fixing. I also used the vim errors to give me a better idea of what to fix.

Discussion

	I used vim to write code for the first time and I a good sense of the benefits of using vim over eclipse. It was really easy to rewrite and test code all on the same screen.

	Most of my errors were do to minor mistakes in my syntax or a mix up with the java syntax that I am more accustomed to.
