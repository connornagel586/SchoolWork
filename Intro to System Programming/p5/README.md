Shell Scripting
===================

Project 5

Author: Connor Nagel
Class: CS253 Section 1

Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script builds and runs the program wf with inputs from the input folder, it then checks if the
two options for the program yield the same result.


Compiling and Using
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run ./tester.sh input

Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To test this script I used echo on different variables to check and see whether
or not they were correct.



Discussion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While working with this project I got to know shell scripting pretty well. The most difficult part
for me was figuring out how to format the time output correctly. I also was stuck on the for loop
until I remembered that `...` would allow me to use other commands within commands.
