## Discussion

Most of the diffculty I had with this project was trying to position every detail of the avatar and truck in the right spot. I had to do a lot of guess and check to get it close to right. The most common error I dealt with had to do with inputting the correct values into the fill.oval and draw.Arc functions. I tried to use doubles to make my values more accurate, but the graphics methods that I was using wouldn't take double values, so I had to change them back.
