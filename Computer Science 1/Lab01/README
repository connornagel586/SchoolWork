Removed semi-colons from the HelloWorld.java file. Created an error when compiling.

Added a println statement that reads "Put that cookie DOWN!" and then starts a new line.

Changed HelloWorld to helloworld, changed main to Main, removed a semi-colon. When compiled the program crashed. So all the changes must be recalled.

Created a new file called Quote.java, added in 3 quotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger.
added comments to the Quote file.
