##Discussion
This project was by far the most difficult work I have done in this class. I spent some 15-20 hours working out all of the methods and bugs. Most of my errors were null pointer exceptions, which were easier to fix than other errors, but the frequency of which they occured was frustrating. I received help from numerous students, tutors and faculty to get this project done, and I'm still certain that the program is full of bugs and weird logic errors. Regardless of my frustrations I can tell that I am much more comfortable working with GUI code and understanding listener logic.
