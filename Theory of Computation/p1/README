Project p1p1: DFA

Author: Connor Nagel
Class: CS361 Section 1
Semester: Spring 2017

##Overview

This program takes in a formatted txt file to generate a DFA. It prints the information to sys.out.

##Compiling and Using

javac fa.dfa.DFADriver.java
java fa.dfa.DFADriver <filePath>

Possible issue: The class might have issue with a fresh FAInterface.java, I made some changes to my FAInterface. Discussed below.

##Discussion

For the most part this project went by pretty well. I had very few issues getting the program to do what I wanted. However, I had trouble figuring out how to adhere to the FAInterface and still use a extended DFAState class. I decided to change some of the return types in the interface to make it work. I'm sure there is a way to do it without resorting to that, please let me know what it is so I can fix my code writing for the future.

##Testing

I tested this program with the provided .txt files and the eclipse debugger. If I couldn't determine the issue from those resources I would sysout certain variables to see if they were holding the correct values.
